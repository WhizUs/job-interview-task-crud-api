# Notes

- The architecture doesn't have to be fully defined - there can be open topics, that's what the internal meeting is for.
- You can make a simple diagramm, or just write notes and explain it during the presentation.
- Please also think about the why
- If anything is not clearly defined, you can always contact WhizCorp and ask them on an improved definition, or just make assumptions on your own and write them down.

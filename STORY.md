# The Story

## WhizKube Consult

You are a backend developer at WhizCorp, and you're tasked with revamping an existing application, AppXYZ, which currently offers a SOAP-based CRUD API interfacing with a flat file database. This application is witnessing a surge in demand, hence it is expected to handle more data and accommodate more API requests.

Your challenge is to design a new application using modern best practices and build a very basic proof-of-concept (POC). This POC does not need to be optimized for performance or include any security at this point, however these considerations should be factored into your overall design and architecture. 
You have been suggested to use Spring Boot as the primary framework for this endeavor.

Before you go to the client to present the POC and architecture, you will have an internal feedback meeting with your colleagues from WhizCorp, Alice and Bob.


## Questions to get started

* How would you structure this new application, considering the given specifications and requirements?
* What kind of database would you recommend for this scenario, and what are your reasons for this choice?
* What development methodology/concept would you adopt for this project and why?
* Are there any additional frameworks or libraries you would incorporate into this project?
* Is there anything else to consider?

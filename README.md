# CRUD API application

In this task we will take look into the setup of a simple CRUD API application.


## Guidance

1. Read [the story](STORY.md)
2. Read the [notes](NOTES.md)
3. Think of the best practices on how to create such an application and take into consideration your personal work experience.
4. Create a simple POC that is startable. It doesn't need many endpoints or complex objects, it's just a POC where you need to hadnle the api, the database connection and the mapping.
5. Review with Alice and Bob what you have created.


## Additional task

* If you have additional time, you can also think of the migration of the data from the legacy database, how to handle it with a small/no downtime of the application, and how much extra work this would be (does the PO want to use that amount of time or can he live with a short downtime?)
